*Now Synthesizer V Studio's 1.10.0b1 release includes a way to change the tracks colours directly from the interface itself with some premade swatches. The final version (1.10.0) also includes a color picker.*
This repository will remain archived but the final build will still be downloadable. Thanks for your support!

## DISCLAIMER
Note: This software has been done in an evening so it could be done way faster if I knew how Windows Forms works but this will do the trick for now.
If any of the copyright holders wants me to take it down, I will without any problem.

This application was done without any reverse-engineering, it was done purely reading the .svp file structure.
