## DISCLAIMER
Note: This software has been done in an evening so it could be done way faster if I knew how Windows Forms works but this will do the trick for now.
If any of the copyright holders wants me to take it down, I will without any problem.

This application was done without any reverse-engineering, it was done purely reading the .svp file structure.
